# Summer-FURSCA-Mark
There are 3 parts of my research:

I. Diversity and richness of cryptic species in Oceans:
1. R files: there are 6 R files. I have named and commented them.
2. cvs files: these consist of tables and occurrence data properly labled
3. png: these are graphs I made.

II. Aurelia analysis:
You may see an overview of what I have done first in the file "Aurita Research.pdf"
1. R file: Aurelia.R
2. png: Phylogenies are named "Phy_Aurelia_...."
3. DNA sequences are fas. or aln. They are named "Seq_Aurelia_...."

III. Mola analysis:
You may see an overview of what I have done first in the file "Mola Research.pdf"
1. R file: Mola_cryptic.R
2. png: Phylogenies are named "Phy_Mola_...."
        Occurrence map are named "Map_Mola_..."
3. DNA sequences are fas. or aln. They are named "Seq_Mola_...."
