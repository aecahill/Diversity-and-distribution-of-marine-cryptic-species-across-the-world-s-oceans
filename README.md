# Diversity and distribution of marine cryptic species across the worldâ€™s oceans!

Cryptic species are nominal biological species without morphological differences. Many marine cryptic species are believed to not yet be discovered or miscategorized, and systematic work about their frequency and distribution is lacking. Failing to acknowledge and recognize CS can have consequences for our understanding of diversification processes, including calculating basic parameters of species diversity and richness. We conducted this research to answer long-standing questions about marine CS richness and diversity in the five major oceans of the world. Occurrence data for all marine animals were extracted from the OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) with a world oceans map created based on Marine Regions (https://marineregions.org/) and were processed and analyzed with R programming. A prior literature review identified 675 cases of marine metazoan CS, allowing us to compare patterns of CS distribution with that of all animals. We found that the richness of CS is higher than expected in the Arctic Ocean and lower than expected in the Pacific Ocean, relative to the distribution of all species in OBIS. Second, we found that the Beta diversity of cryptic species (based on 1000-mile grain sizes) is significantly lower than the Beta diversity of all species except in the Pacific Ocean, where they are not different. That is, in the Pacific Ocean, species with and without CS are evenly distributed. This result aligns with the high number of islands and coral reefs in the Pacific, which may allow CS to be more widespread and evenly distributed in this ocean. With this systematic view of CS distributions and diversity, we will be able to have a better understanding of biodiversity, which can lead to more efficient species conservation and monitoring.
